# 1. Write a method called no_puppies that takes in a number of puppies as an argument.
  #If the number of puppies is greater than zero then this method should return "No more puppies!"
  #otherwise it should return "Well done, Rachel!"
def no_puppies(number_puppies)
  if number_puppies > 0
    "Get back to your animal goals!"
  else
    "Good job, Rachel!"
  end
end


# 2. Rachel's animal accumulation has been going well and we're going to cut her some slack.
  # Write a new method called less_puppies that takes in a number of puppies as an argument
  # and tells Rachel good job when she gets less than 3 puppies,
  # to slow down if she's found exactly 3 puppies,
  # and to get back on her animal restriction if she gets more than 3 puppies.

def less_puppies(number_puppies)
  if number_puppies < 3
    "Good job, Rachel!"
  elsif number_puppies == 3
    "Slow down! No more puppies."
  else
    "Get back to your animal goals!"
  end
end

# 3. We've decided to give Rachel a little more control over her puppy obsession.
  # Write a method called some_puppies that takes in two arguments - the number of puppies she has found and a maximum puppy allowance.
  # This method should tell Rachel good job if she gets less than half her maximum allowance
  #and to get back on her puppy restriction when she exceeds her maximum.

def some_puppies(number_puppies, max_puppy)
  if number_puppies < 0.5*max_puppy
    "Good job, Rachel!"
  elsif number_puppies > max_puppy
    "Get back to your animal goals!"
  end
end

# BONUS
# 4. Rachel has decided to track both her puppy allowance AND her cat allowance.
  # Write a method called new_animal accumulation that takes in two arguments - number of puppies and number of cats.
  # As long as she gets zero puppies OR zero cats this method should return "Good job!".
  # If she gets 1 or more puppies AND 1 or more cats it should tell her she should really slow back down!
